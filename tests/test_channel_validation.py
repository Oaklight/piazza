"""Tests for channel name validation in HttpFrontend.

Verifies:
- User channel naming rules (length, start/end chars, specials)
- Trailing underscore rejection (consistent with other trailing specials)
- 64-char boundary (stated max is 64, not 63)
- Reserved prefix enforcement
- Unicode channel names
